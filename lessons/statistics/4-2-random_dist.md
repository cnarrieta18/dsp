[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

# QUESTION PROMPT
The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their __PMF__ and __CDF__. Is the distribution uniform?

__Step 1:__ Import necessary modules
    
    import thinkstat2
    import thinkplot
    import nsfg
    import numpy as np
    
__Step 2:__ Generate 1000 random numbers using `random.random`

    random_test = np.random.random(1000)
    
__Step 3:__ Compute PMF and plot 

    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_test)
    thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number',ylabel='PMF')        

Output: ![PMF](https://github.com/cnarrieta18/dsp/blob/master/lessons/statistics/4_2_pmf.png)

__Step 4:__ Compute Cummulative Distribution Function (CDF) and plot  

    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_test)
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number',ylabel='CDF')
    
Output: ![CDF](https://github.com/cnarrieta18/dsp/blob/master/lessons/statistics/4_2_cdf.png)


## Conclusion
The distribution looks uniform.  Based on the probability mass distribution, it shows that all numbers between 0 and 1.0 have equal probaility.  And based on the cummulative distribution, the line is nearly linear close to 1:1 confirming a near uniform distribution.
